# Infosec Interview Q&A, Info

## About

This is a collection of Infosec questions and information that helped me. This can also be used to refresh your knowledge or learn new concepts at your current position.

Why make this?

* I had some notes, might as well help out the community the way they helped me
* There is A LOT of info in infosec. It is hard to get started in the field without a guide

**WIP - I have >10 pages of notes and I am currently transcribing it into markdown. Please bear with me.**

This is not comprehensive so feel free to contribute.

## Features
These are WIP. Some are not up yet, but I will add them soon

** GH Actions for style guide, spell check, etc

** PR and Issue Templates

Here are the basic concepts in plain english.

### Permitted items:

* Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
* Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material 

### Required items:

* Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. 
* ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original. 

### Forbidden items:

* NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes. 

### Why this license?

I want to make this freely available but I don't want non-contributing entities to profit from it. I put a lot of thought into the licensing model and this is the best one I could find for this kind of data. 

I see hard work from infosec blogs and guides getting ripped off by "bloggers" and mixed with ads. This is not okay. First of all, all ads are malware, by definition. Secondly, I am not going to profit from this, nor do I want to, so neither should anyone else especially if they did nothing to contribute. This is especially true because very little information is a de facto "new work". Almost all thoughts, ideas, and creations build upon previous works or knowledge. This principle is the idea behind copyright expiration. For example, a certain highly litigious media company could not have made a movie about a princess and a bunch of dwarfs had [the original work not entered the public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White). 

TL;DR - Share this repo, contribute, just don't sell or profit from this.

## Sources
Some of these questions are original, some of them are based on or taken from various blogs. If you took any information from a linkable source, it should be listed here. If something isn't linked, it doesn't mean it was just taken out of thin air. It's not really worth linking reddit or wikipedia if you aren't reproducing content in whole, e.g, an entire comment or paragraph.
