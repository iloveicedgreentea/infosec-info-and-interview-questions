# Infosec Interview Q&A, Info

## About

This is a collection of Infosec questions and information that helped me. This can also be used to refresh your knowledge or learn new concepts at your current position.


I have 10 pages of notes and I am currently transcribing it into markdown. Please bear with me.

This is not comprehensive so feel free to contribute.

Here are the basic concepts in plain english.

### Permitted items:

* Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
* Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material 

### Required items:

* Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. 
* ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original. 

### Forbidden items:

* NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes. 

### Why this license?

I want to make this freely available but I don't want non-contributing entities to profit from it. I put a lot of thought into the licensing model and this is the best one I could find for this kind of data. 

I see hard work from infosec blogs and guides getting ripped off by "bloggers" and mixed with ads. This is not okay. I am not going to profit from this, nor do I want to, so neither should anyone else especially if they did nothing to contribute. This is especially true because very little information is a de facto "new work". Almost all thoughts, ideas, and creations build upon previous works or knowledge. This principle is the idea behind copyright expiration. Well, until a well-known, highly litigious media company decided copyrights should effectively last forever.

TL;DR - Share this repo, contribute, just don't sell or profit from this.
