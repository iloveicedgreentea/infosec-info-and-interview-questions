## Guidelines

### Workflow
I recommend using VS Code because in general, it's just the best editor, but also has really nice support for markdown. 

1) All pages should use the appropriate headings. This will allow linking to specific topics.

* `##` for main points
* `###` for topics under the main points
* `*` for bullet points under `###` headings

2) Check and render your markdown before committing. 
* `Shift + Cmd + V` in VS Code

### General

1) If this helped you, please feel free to share this (but please [read the license first](LICENSE.md)). This is itself a contribution.
2) If you have additional content, improvements, etc, please open a PR and tag me.

### Additions

If you have new content to add, open an issue with the `Feature request` template or open a PR.

Sections should not be microscopic. That is, don't create a section for a specific topic if it relates to an existing one. Only create a section if it is a new genre. For example, attacks on AD should go in `Info/Active_directory.md`, but "Blue Team concepts" might need its own section.

### Corrections

If there is a mistake, typo, etc, open an issue with the `Correction` template or open a PR. No correction is too small, besides white space. Please.
