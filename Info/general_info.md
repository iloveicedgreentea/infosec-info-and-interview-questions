# General Info

## Interview Tips

These are generally geared towards remote interviews.

* Be generally prepared
    - Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature. Sweating or shivering will destroy your train of thought.
    - Make sure the room is well lit. Test your camera before the interview. Make sure you can be clearly seen and heard.
    - Clear your area of all distractions. Silence your phone. Close unneeded programs.
    - Make sure you ate enough before.
    - Have water within arms reach.

* Write out your notes and have them in front of you. This will help you convey your thoughts without getting lost.
    - Who you are
    - Non-tech things you do
    - Important talking points
    - Some technical references if needed

* Take time to learn about the company and your interviewers.
    * A new company is a commitment. You are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. 
    * Research the company on Linkedin and Glassdoor.
    * Look for mutual interests, talking points, etc. Remember, you are working with real people. It's good to make friends.
    * Look for things that you should ask about - compensation structure, internal process, home office reimbursements, etc
    * Look for red flags. Are there reviews mentioning poor processes? Bad interview questions? [Brain puzzles](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/google-finally-admits-that-its-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/277053/)? 
    * In general, have a list of questions to ask. Even if you know the answers, asking questions will show them you are interested. Companies would generally rather hire an enthusiastic Junior than a Senior who isn't interested in the company. You can teach skills. You can't really teach enthusiasm.


## Where do you get your news/info from?

In my opinion, these are good places to get news. It's very important to keep up with all kinds of news - attacks, bugs, new tools, etc

* Twitter
* https://reddit.com/r/netsec
* https://www.theregister.co.uk/
* Krebs
* Schneier
* Threatpost
* Troy Hunt
* Infosec slacks

All of these will source things from each other.

You can also set up a free Feedly feed with a bunch of resources from the above to get a single dashboard of info.

## Who do you follow in the industry?

Related to the above, it's important to follow important people/groups in the industry outside of looking at news. This mostly applies to twitter.

## What are your favorite tools?

This question is only helpful to start a conversation and judge your familiarity with the entire space, not the tools themselves. Can you name 5 security tools right now? What are they for and why would you use one over the other?

Don't say Kali.
