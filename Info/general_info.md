## Interview Tips

These are generally geared towards remote interviews.

* Be generally prepared

    - Clear your area of all distractions. Silence your phone. Close unneeded programs.
    - Make sure you ate enough before.
    - Have water within arms reach.

* Write out your notes and have them in front of you. This will help you convey your thoughts without getting lost.
    - Who you are
    - Non-tech things you do
    - Important talking points
    - Some technical references if needed
