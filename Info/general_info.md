# General Info

## Interview Tips

These are generally geared towards remote interviews.

* Be generally prepared
    - Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature. Sweating or shivering will destroy your train of thought.
    - Make sure the room is well lit. Test your camera before the interview. Make sure you can be clearly seen and heard.
    - Clear your area of all distractions. Silence your phone. Close unneeded programs.
    - Make sure you ate enough before.
    - Have water within arms reach.

* Write out your notes and have them in front of you. This will help you convey your thoughts without getting lost.
    - Who you are
    - Non-tech things you do
    - Important talking points
    - Some technical references if needed

* Take time to learn about the company and your interviewers.
    * A new company is a commitment. You are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. 
    * Research the company on Linkedin and Glassdoor.
    * Look for mutual interests, talking points, etc. Remember, you are working with real people. It's good to make friends.
    * Look for things that you should ask about - compensation structure, internal process, home office reimbursements, etc
    * Look for red flags. Are there reviews mentioning poor processes? Bad interview questions? [Brain puzzles](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/google-finally-admits-that-its-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/277053/)? 
    * In general, have a list of questions to ask. Even if you know the answers, asking questions will show them you are interested. Companies would generally rather hire an enthusiastic Junior than a Senior who isn't interested in the company. You can teach skills. You can't really teach enthusiasm.

* Don't just give anwers; have conversations. 
    * Give context to your answers - why do you think X and not Y? How did you arrive at your opinion?
    * Wrong answers are okay if you frame your opinion
    * Not knowing an answer is fine if you can take an educated guess or talk though it. It looks really bad to simply say you don't know and make no attempt to figure it out.
        * "I don't know X, but it works like this with Y so maybe XYZ" or "I don't know off the top of my head but I can research that after and get back to you"
    * It's okay to not know something. It's 2020 - we have Google. If you don't know how to invert a binary tree, as someone who isn't a software engineer, who cares!? [You can google it.](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?lang=en)
    

## Where do you get your news/info from?

In my opinion, these are some good places to get news. It's very important to keep up with all kinds of news - attacks, bugs, new tools, etc. 

* Twitter
* https://reddit.com/r/netsec
* https://www.theregister.co.uk/
* Krebs
* Schneier
* Threatpost
* Troy Hunt
* Slacks (Hangops, other private ones)

You can also set up Feedly with a bunch of resources from the above, and others, to get a single dashboard of info.

## Who do you follow in the industry?

Related to the above, it's important to follow important people/groups in the industry outside of looking at news. This mostly applies to twitter.

## What are your favorite tools?

This question is only helpful to start a conversation and judge your familiarity with the entire space, not the tools themselves. Can you name 5 security tools right now? What are they for and why would you use one over the other?

Don't say Kali.
