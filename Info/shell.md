# Shell

Very WIP


## Bash basics


## RE Concepts
You can get some info from these tools

### File
Get the file type, headers, etc. This will tell you what kind of file this is so you can choose your next steps.

### Strings
Dump all strings found in the file. In easy CTFs, they sometimes hide a flag in the binary. You can infer things about the file from the strings you find. Sometimes, even get passwords.


### Binwalk
Full on dump a firmware image. You can extract it in whole or in parts.
