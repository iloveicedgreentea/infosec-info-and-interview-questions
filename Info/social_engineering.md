## Phone calls
As a blanket rule, assume everyone on an inbound call is a liar and trying to get something from you until *proven* otherwise. A simple way to verify them is to give you a callback number and verify it with their company. For example, someone calls you from your bank (unlikely in any case). Ask them for a callback number, call your bank's posted number, and have them verify it. Never give personal info over the phone.
